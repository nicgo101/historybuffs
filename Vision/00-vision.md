## The Problem

History, as commonly understood, is not a collection of facts. It is a collection of narratives — constructed by victors, filtered through institutions, shaped by agendas, and often tracing back to surprisingly few primary sources.

When examined closely, what appears to be a rich canopy of independent historical knowledge often converges to single roots: one chronicle, one historian, one document of uncertain provenance. The appearance of consensus masks the fragility of the foundation.

Meanwhile, anomalies accumulate:
- Physical evidence that doesn't match timelines
- Structures that defy explained capabilities
- Sources that contradict each other
- Patterns that span cultures but "shouldn't" connect
- Questions that receive ridicule rather than engagement

The tools we have for exploring history assume the mainstream narrative. They organize data around accepted chronology, accepted geography, accepted interpretation. To question is to step outside the tools entirely.

## The Vision

**A tool for seeing history without the explanatory overlay.**

Not to prove an alternative narrative. Not to assert what's true. But to organize observations, sources, and connections in a way that lets patterns emerge — and lets users think for themselves.

Imagine:
- Clicking on any historical "fact" and watching its source tree descend — through citations, through secondary sources, down to the root. Seeing whether that rich canopy traces to many independent origins or to a single questionable document.
- Applying different reference frames — astronomical anchors, dendrochronology, revised chronologies — watching events shift, cluster differently, reveal alignments or gaps that weren't visible before.
- Tracing how a piece of knowledge traveled — who said it first, who copied whom, where the chain breaks.
- Seeing which voices are preserved and which are absent. Understanding not just what we're told, but what we're *not* told, and why.

## Core Principles

### 1. Data Agnostic
The tool doesn't know what's "true." It organizes, connects, reveals. It holds mainstream and alternative interpretations side by side without privileging either. Truth emerges from patterns, not from authority.

### 2. Source Primacy
Everything traces back. No floating facts. Every claim links to its source, every source to its origin. If something can't be sourced, it's flagged as tradition/hearsay — still valuable, but marked.

### 3. Multi-Frame Chronology
No single timeline is privileged. A factoid can be placed in multiple reference frames — mainstream academic dating, astronomical anchors, dendrochronology, Newton's revised chronology, biblical frameworks, mythological parallels, or user-defined combinations. Frames can be layered, toggled, and re-anchored. The *gaps and shifts* between frames are themselves data. Where a claim moves dramatically depending on which lens you apply, that movement reveals something about the claim's foundation.

### 4. Contradiction as Feature
When sources conflict, both are preserved. The conflict itself is informative. We don't resolve contradictions by choosing sides — we display them.

### 5. Pattern Emergence
The tool should surface what humans would miss: clusters, convergences, suspicious gaps, over-cited single sources, circular dependencies. Not by asserting conclusions, but by making patterns visible.

### 6. No Editorial Voice
The system doesn't tell you what to think. It shows you what's there. It raises questions rather than answering them. The user's conclusions are their own.

### 7. Transparency All The Way Down
The code is open source. The algorithms are inspectable. The confidence calculations show their work. If we ask users to question historical authorities, we cannot ask them to trust us blindly.

## What This Is Not

- **Not a counter-narrative platform**: We don't push alternative theories. We provide tools to examine all narratives.
- **Not a debunking tool**: We don't set out to disprove mainstream history. We set out to make its structure visible.
- **Not an echo chamber**: By separating community confidence from core confidence, by requiring independent verification, we resist becoming a new form of groupthink.
- **Not relativist**: We're not saying "all narratives are equal." We're saying "show your work." Well-sourced claims with independent verification *do* score higher. But the scoring is transparent and based on methodology, not authority.

## The Canopy and the Roots

The central metaphor:

From above, historical knowledge looks like a rich forest canopy — countless books, papers, documentaries, all confirming each other. "Historians agree." "Well-established fact." "Scientific consensus."

But forests have root systems. And sometimes, when you trace the citations down through the layers, that rich canopy narrows. And narrows. Until you find that a dozen textbooks and a hundred Wikipedia articles all trace back to... one chronicle. One historian writing centuries after the events. One document that appeared under suspicious circumstances.

This tool makes the roots visible. It lets you see whether a "fact" stands on a broad foundation of independent evidence — or balances on a single questionable point.

Neither result tells you what's true. But one tells you the confidence is earned. The other tells you it's borrowed.

## The User's Journey

A user comes to this tool and can:

**Explore**: Navigate history as terrain. See where data is dense, where it's sparse. Discover patterns they weren't looking for.

**Question**: Click on any claim and see its foundation. Follow the source tree to its roots. See who said what based on whom.

**Compare**: Toggle between reference frames. What does history look like under mainstream dating? Under compressed chronology? Under astronomical anchors only? Re-anchor the timeline around a verified astronomical event and see which claims hold position, which drift, and which collapse entirely.

**Contribute**: Add sources they've found. Document artifacts. Make connections. Become part of a community building a clearer picture.

**Create**: Use the data for presentations, videos, education. Generate visualizations grounded in historical evidence. Tell stories that honor complexity.

Throughout, the tool doesn't tell them what to conclude. It gives them the information to conclude for themselves.

## The Invitation

*Think for yourself. See for yourself.*

History is too important to be left to authorities. The past shapes how we understand the present and imagine the future. If the past is distorted — by accident, by agenda, by simple accumulation of errors — we navigate the present with a broken compass.

This tool is an invitation to look closer. To ask questions. To follow threads. To notice what doesn't fit. To hold conclusions loosely while examining evidence carefully.

Not everyone will want this. Some prefer the comfort of settled narratives. That's fine.

But for those who sense that something doesn't add up — who notice anomalies and want to explore them — who believe that honest uncertainty is better than false confidence —

This is for you.

## Open Questions

- **Name**: The project needs a name that captures the mission without being too provocative to be immediately dismissed. Something that suggests exploration, pattern-finding, truth-seeking.

- **Tone**: How do we present this to mainstream users without triggering immediate dismissal? How do we welcome alternative researchers without becoming associated with any particular theory?

- **Boundaries**: Are there any claims we won't host? How do we handle genuinely harmful content (not merely controversial, but actually dangerous)?

*The tool is agnostic. The user thinks for themselves. The patterns speak.*
